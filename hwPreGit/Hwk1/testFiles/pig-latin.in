**Pig Latin** is a [language game](language_game "wikilink") or
[argot](argot "wikilink") in which words in
[English](English_language "wikilink") are altered, usually by adding a
fabricated [suffix](suffix "wikilink") or by moving the
[onset](Syllable#Onset "wikilink") or initial
[consonant](consonant "wikilink") or [consonant
cluster](consonant_cluster "wikilink") of a word to the end of the word
and adding a [vocalic](vocalic "wikilink")
[syllable](syllable "wikilink") to create such a suffix. The objective
is to [conceal the words](Obfuscation "wikilink") from others not
familiar with the rules. The reference to
[Latin](Latin_language "wikilink") is a deliberate
[misnomer](misnomer "wikilink"); Pig Latin is simply a form of
[argot](argot "wikilink") or [jargon](jargon "wikilink") unrelated to
Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange
and foreign-sounding language. pig latin is spoken by taking the first
letter in a word and then putting it at the end then adding an -ay

Origins and history
-------------------

Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today
call [dog Latin](dog_Latin "wikilink"), a type of parody Latin. Examples
of this predate even [Shakespeare](Shakespeare "wikilink"), whose 1598
play, *[Love's Labour's Lost](Love's_Labour's_Lost "wikilink")*,
includes a reference to dog Latin:

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to
current pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the
boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify
eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge
go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative says, 'Noge,
Ige woge.' "[^1]

Another early mention of the name was in *[Putnam's
Magazine](Putnam's_Magazine "wikilink")* in May 1869 "I had plenty of
ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus,
piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing,"
although the jargon is dog Latin.

*[The Atlantic](The_Atlantic "wikilink")* January 1895 also included a
mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they
themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig
Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of pig Latin appears in a 1919 [Columbia
Records](Columbia_Records "wikilink") album containing what sounds like
the modern variation, by a singer named [Arthur
Fields](Arthur_Fields "wikilink"). The song, called [Pig Latin
Love](https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove), is followed by the
subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".[^2] [The Three
Stooges](The_Three_Stooges "wikilink") used it on multiple occasions,
most notably *[Tassels in the Air](Tassels_in_the_Air "wikilink")*, a
1938 short where [Moe Howard](Moe_Howard "wikilink") attempts to teach
[Curley Howard](Curley_Howard "wikilink") how to use it, thereby
conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode,
*[Three Little Pigskins](Three_Little_Pigskins "wikilink")*, [Larry
Fine](Larry_Fine "wikilink") attempts to impress a woman with his skill
in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of
the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the *[Our
Gang](Our_Gang "wikilink")* [short film](short_film "wikilink") *[Washee
Ironee](Washee_Ironee "wikilink")*, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian
boy by using Pig Latin.[^3] [Ginger Rogers](Ginger_Rogers "wikilink")
sang a verse of [We're in the Money](We're_in_the_Money "wikilink") in
pig Latin in an elaborate [Busby Berkeley](Busby_Berkeley "wikilink")
production number in the film [Gold Diggers of
1933](Gold_Diggers_of_1933 "wikilink"), (). The film, the third highest
grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and
that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American
Film Institute. [Merle Travis](Merle_Travis "wikilink") ends his song
*When My Baby Double Talks To Me* with the phrase, "What a aybybay",
where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as
we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end
of a word and then adding "ay".[^4]

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English
are "" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "" (itself a borrowing of
[German](German_language "wikilink") *nichts*[^5]), which is used as a
general [negative](Negative_(language) "wikilink"); and "", Pig Latin
for "", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".[^6][^7][^8][^9]

Rules
-----

For words that begin with [consonant](consonant "wikilink") sounds, all
letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word
sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:[^10]

-   "latin" = "atinlay"
-   "banana" = "ananabay"
-   "trash" = "ashtray"
-   "happy" = "appyhay"
-   "duck" = "uckday"
-   "dopest" = "opestday"
-   "me" = "emay"
-   "too" = "ootay"
-   "will" = "illway"
-   "moist" = "oistmay"
-   "wet" = "etway"
-   "real" = "ealray"
-   "simple" = "implesay"
-   "say" = "aysay"
-   "words" = "ordsway"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form
one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or
writing.[^11]

-   "cheers" = "eerschay"
-   "shesh" = "eshshay"
-   "smile" = "ilesmay"
-   "string" = "ingstray"
-   "thanks" = "anksthay"
-   "stupid" = "upidstay"
-   "glove" = "oveglay"
-   "thanks" = "anksthay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to
the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:

-   "eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
-   "omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
-   "are" = "areway" or "areay"
-   "egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
-   "explain" = "explainway"
-   "always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
-   "ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one
removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant
cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable
and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the
mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:

-   "every" = "eryevay"
-   "omelet" = "eletomay"
-   "another" = "otheranay"
-   "under" = "derunay"
-   "island" = "andislay"
-   "elegant" = "egantelay"

Notable days and events
-----------------------

Pig Latin Awareness Month is the month of September.

Pig Latin Day is September 15.

In other languages
------------------

In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include
[Kedelkloppersprook](Kedelkloppersprook "wikilink"), which originated
around [Hamburg](Hamburg "wikilink") harbour, and
[Mattenenglisch](Mattenenglisch "wikilink") that was used in the
*Matte*, the traditional [working-class](working_class "wikilink")
neighborhood of [Bern](Bern "wikilink"). Though Mattenenglisch has
fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by
[voluntary associations](voluntary_association "wikilink"). A
characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete
substitution of the first vowel by *i*, in addition to the usual moving
of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of *ee*.

The [Swedish](Swedish_language "wikilink") equivalent of Pig Latin is
Fikonspråket ("Fig language" see [Language game § List of common
language
games](Language_game#List_of_common_language_games "wikilink")).

The [Finnish](Finnish_language "wikilink") Pig Latin is called
Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word
kontti "container", then switch the first syllables. For example,
wikipedia kontti --&gt; kokipedia wintti. Minä rakastan sinua ("I love
you") would result in konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti.

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the
[Slavic](Slavic_language "wikilink")-speaking parts of the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"). It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or
"[Šatrovački](Šatrovački "wikilink")" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in
crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name
for [marijuana](marijuana "wikilink") (trava - meaning "grass") turns to
"vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [cocaine](cocaine "wikilink") (belo -
meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [pistol](pistol "wikilink") (pištolj)
turns to štoljpi, [bro](brother "wikilink") (brate) turns to tebra. In
the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants
in former [Yugoslavian](Yugoslavia "wikilink") countries.

In [Italian](Italian_language "wikilink"), the *[alfabeto
farfallino](Farfallino_alphabet "wikilink")* uses a similar encoding.

[French](French_language "wikilink") has the
*[loucherbem](Louchébem "wikilink")* (or *louchébem*, or
*largonji*[^12]) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by
butchers (*boucher* in French).[^13] In *loucherbem*, the leading
consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and
replaced by an *L*, and then a suffix is added at the end of the word
(-*oche*, -*em*, -*oque*, etc., depending on the word). Example:
*combien* (how much) = *lombienquès*. Similar coded languages are
*[verlan](verlan "wikilink")* and *langue de feu* (see [:fr:Javanais
(argot)](:fr:Javanais_(argot) "wikilink"). A few louchébem words have
become usual French words: *fou* (crazy) = *loufoque*, *portefeuille*
(wallet) = *larfeuille*, *en douce* (on the quiet) = *en loucedé*. Also
similar is the widely used French argot *[verlan](verlan "wikilink")*,
in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang
that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a
word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th
century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in
effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other
people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in
areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers.
This language has served as a language bridge between many of these
migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so
widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film
scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French
dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have
actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how
it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened
within just a few decades.[^14]

Here is an example of some French words that have been Verlanned and
their English meaning:[^15]

    from?](http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/)\
    The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know
    today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia
    records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin
    Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that
    this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able
    to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below
    the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”,
    suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root
    among the general public yet.
